The square tool post design above is a mockup model of a common tool post 
desing used in various technical institution's workshops.

The purpose behind this is to allow for local production of the old commercially 
available tool posts within my institution.

The technical documention for the parts making this tool post up have long been
misplaced over the past 50 years of use of these tool post. The design model with its
accurate measurements will allow for one to easily repair broken parts by referencing 
this model.
